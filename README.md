# EcoU

EcoU is an online platform dedicated to educating and encouraging the community to take action towards mitigating environmental issues. Some major environmental issues are pollution, deforestation, or climate change, we provide a collaborative space for individuals to come together and make a difference. On this platform, users are able to pin a location they believe needs ecological attention. Poor water quality, trash in the community, and soil degradation are a few examples. Our platform's goal is to educate people on the significance of caring about environmental problems because we only have one planet.

## Installation Instructions

Our platform is fairly simple to use. We currently do not have a downloadable app. However, we did get a free .tech domain from the hackathon my group participated in University of Michigan-Dearborn. Users can type ecoU.tech into their web browser and find our platform.

## Usage

To access the main feature of our website, the user must allow the website to access their location. The main use of our platform is the Microsoft Bing Maps API, where users are able to pin a location they believe requires ecological attention. They can also browse the navigation bar for many more activities. Under the "Information" tab, users can learn more about the ongoing environmental issues going on. The "Support the Environment" tab is where users would go to click on ads, which in theory should give the platform funds to donate to charities focused on mitigating effects of climate change. The "Games" tab contains mockups of mini-games that would engage the users in a fun way while also educating about environmental issues such as deforestation and plastic pollution. The "Community" and "My Profile" tab give users the opportunity to engage with a community whether that group is their friends, local neighborhood, or school organizations. Users can meet up in order to collectively help the environment.
