        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>EcoU was created with a mission to unite communities and raise awareness about local and global environmental issues. We strongly believe that collective action is the key to minimizing the impact of these issues. While big steps can be challenging, we encourage people to take small actions that can make a big difference when done together. Our goal is to inspire individuals to take responsibility for their environmental footprint and to make conscious choices that benefit the planet. By coming together, we can create a better future for ourselves and future generations.
