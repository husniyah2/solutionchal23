            <h3>Fossil Fuels</h3>
            <p>Today, the major contributing factor of climate change is fossil fuels. We can see effects of the globally increasing temperatures when we look at bushfires in US and Australia and heatwaves in Anartica.</p>

            <h3>Food Waste</h3>
            <p>Another major environmental problem is food waste. According to earth.org, “A third of the food intended for human consumption – around 1.3 billion tons – is wasted or lost. This is enough to feed 3 billion people.” in developed countries such as the US, a shocking amount of food is thrown out because it’s not presentable to customers.</p>

            <h3>Plastic Pollution</h3>
            <p>Plastic pollution is also undoubtedly a concerncing environmental issue. Animals and wildlife habitats are harmed and endangered as roughly “14 million tons of plastic” are thrown into the ocean each year (earth.org). Use of plastic is not sustainable as it takes 400 years to decompose. This means that plastic will be around for a very long time and its amount will accumulate.</p>

            <h3>HELP OUT</h3>
         <p>All the above environmental issues are important, but here’s one that’s equailly important if not more. According to earth.org, forests the size of 300 football fields are cut down every hour. Trees are the main absorbers of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere and produce oxygen. Without these trees, CO2 would be roaming in our atmosphere and contribute to global warming even further.

            These are just a few of the environmental issues going on. There are many more including air pollution, melting of ice capsm etc.
            
            Yeah, so many problems exist. But what can you do to help? You might be surprised to know that even small steps taken collectively by a community can be effective in addressing these issues.
            
            Here are some things you can do in order to improve our environment.
            Plant a tree.
            Switch from plastic grocery bags to reusable bags.
            RECYCLE!
            Conserve water in your home. Don’t leave the faucet running while brushing your teeth.
            Most importantly, educate yourself and others about the ongoing environmental issues and what you can do to help.
